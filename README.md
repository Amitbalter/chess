This app is a project in full-stack web development.

It is currently possible to play opponents both online, offline and against the computer* 

The deployed site can be found at https://chess-client-2upu.onrender.com/#/.

To run locally:

Ensure the node version is at least v23.3.0.
Clone the repository. 
Start the backend server by running 'npm run start'. 
Start the frontend by running 'npm run dev'.

Note: make sure to run the backend on port 1234 and the frontend on port 3000. These can be changed in the client/src/api.js and the serve/index.js files.

*The hard difficulty is currently slow and is under maintainance.
